To compute the business hour mismatch between Grubhub and UberEats for restaurants, you can follow these steps using SQL. Since the task involves comparing business hours stored as JSON data in BigQuery, a detailed explanation of the query construction is provided:

### Step 1: Extract and Flatten JSON Data

First, extract and flatten the JSON data for both UberEats and Grubhub business hours. The JSON data needs to be parsed to access the business hours properly.

For **UberEats** business hours, assuming we need to handle JSON parsing and `unnest` any arrays:

```sql
-- UberEats: Extract and Flatten Business Hours
WITH ubereats_hours AS (
    SELECT 
        b_name,
        vb_name,
        day,
        start_time,
        end_time
    FROM (
        SELECT 
            b_name,
            vb_name,
            -- Assuming the JSON structure has a regularHours array
            -- This extracts and flattens the time windows
            json_column_expression
            FROM `arboreal-vision-339901.take_home_v2.virtual_kitchen_ubereats_hours`
    )
)

```

For **Grubhub**, follow a similar approach:

```sql
-- Grubhub: Extract and Flatten Business Hours
WITH grubhub_hours AS (
    SELECT 
        slug,
        b_name,
        vb_name,
        day,
        start_time,
        end_time
    FROM (
        SELECT 
            slug,
            b_name,
            vb_name,
            -- Assuming a similar JSON structure to extract the necessary fields
            json_column_expression
            FROM `arboreal-vision-339901.take_home_v2.virtual_kitchen_grubhub_hours`
    )
)
```
### Step 2: Join the Two Tables on Store Identifier

Join UberEats and Grubhub tables based on the store identifier (considering `b_name` and `vb_name` as keys):

```sql
WITH joined_hours AS (
    SELECT 
        ue.b_name,
        ue.vb_name,
        ue.day AS ue_day,
        ue.start_time AS ue_start_time,
        ue.end_time AS ue_end_time,
        gh.day AS gh_day,
        gh.start_time AS gh_start_time,
        gh.end_time AS gh_end_time
    FROM ubereats_hours ue
    LEFT JOIN grubhub_hours gh
    ON ue.b_name = gh.b_name AND ue.vb_name = gh.vb_name AND ue.day = gh.day
)
```

### Step 3: Calculate the Business Hours Mismatch

Now calculate the mismatch between the UberEats and Grubhub hours:

```sql
-- Calculate Business Hours Mismatch
SELECT 
    b_name,
    vb_name,
    CASE 
        WHEN gh_start_time IS NULL OR gh_end_time IS NULL 
            THEN 'Out of Range'
        WHEN gh_start_time >= DATE_ADD(ue_start_time, INTERVAL -5 MINUTE) 
             AND gh_end_time <= DATE_ADD(ue_end_time, INTERVAL 5 MINUTE) 
            THEN 'In Range'
        WHEN (gh_start_time < DATE_ADD(ue_start_time, INTERVAL -5 MINUTE) 
             OR gh_end_time > DATE_ADD(ue_end_time, INTERVAL 5 MINUTE)) 
             AND gh_start_time >= DATE_ADD(ue_start_time, INTERVAL -5 MINUTE)
             AND gh_end_time <= DATE_ADD(ue_end_time, INTERVAL 5 MINUTE)
            THEN 'Out of Range with 5 mins difference'
        ELSE 'Out of Range'
    END AS is_out_of_range
FROM joined_hours
```

### Explanation:

1. **WITH Clause**: Used for breaking down complex queries and making them readable. Here, it flattens JSON data and joins the datasets.
2. **LEFT JOIN**: Allows identification of when a Grubhub entry does not have a corresponding UberEats hour, which we treat as 'Out of Range'.
3. **CASE Statement**: Evaluates the conditions to determine if the Grubhub hours fall within the UberEats time range, exactly match (within Â±5 minutes), or are simply out of range.

By executing the above queries in sequence, you'll achieve the intended objective of computing the business hour mismatch between UberEats and Grubhub for various stores.
